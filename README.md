I have no idea what you're doing here lmao
But since you are, here's some info about me

I (barely) know only 2 languages:
- `.sh`
- `.c`

that's it lol, that's all of my coding abilities
(I did take some college course on Java and C#, but with great effort and determination I managed to forget most of that OOP slop)

Things which I obsess over a lot more than I should:
* SVG (XML is BAE <3)
* Blender (Blender is the best program ever made by human hands | Change my mind )
* GCODE (coming soon)
* Shaders and computing on the GPU (coming soon)
