### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have no idea what you're doing here lmao
But since you are, here's some info about me

Things that I am bad at:
* shellscript
* Networking
* Front-end
* Python
* Rust
* C


that's it lol, that's all of my coding abilities

Things which I obsess over a lot more than I should:
* SVG (XML is BAE <3)
* Blender (Blender is the best program ever made by human hands | Change my mind )
* GCODE (coming soon)
* Shaders and computing on the GPU (coming soon)
